<!-- 1. HTML Basics -->

<!-- # what is Html ? -->
<!-- Hypertext Markup Language used to structure content on the webpage (browser/dom) -->

<!-- # Tags -->
<!-- A Tag is a syntax that used to create an element. -->
<!-- Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (<>). -->
<!-- there are opening tags (<div>) as well as closing tags (</div>). -->
<!-- i.e: <div></div> -->

<!-- # Elements -->
<!-- A Element is complete Tag with opening tags, closing tags, content inside the tags -->
<!-- And more additional informations like attributes, styles, event handlers etc... -->
<!-- i.e <div>Hello Messi</div> -->

<!-- # Self Closing Elements -->
<!-- A Self Closing elements that does not require closing tags, because it doesnt have any content inside -->
<!-- Otherwise called as void elements -->
<!-- i.e <img />, <br />, <hr />, <input /> etc... -->

<!-- # Block level elements -->
<!-- ELements that are start on a new line, they occupies full width of screen (available by default) -->
<!-- i.e <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <section>, <article>, <header>, <footer>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <table> etc... -->

<!-- # Inline elements -->
<!-- Elements that aren't start on a new line, only takes as much as width needed -->
<!-- i.e <span>, <a>, <img>, <label>, <strong>, <emp> etc... -->

<!-- 2. HTML Structure -->

<!-- # Basic HTML template -->
<!-- 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </body>
</html> 

1. <!DOCTYPE html> - its not a Tag, its a declaration, that tell the web browser which version of HTML we are using, it must be at the very top of the HTML elements
2. <html lang="en"> - this wraps all the contents of the webpage both visible as well as the hidden contents. lang is a attribute that tells the web browser which language we are using, mostly helpfull in SEO 
3. <head> - its a metadata section - metadata means "data about data", it gives information about the webpage but isn't visible to the end users.
4. What goes inside the <head> section
    # <title> - title of the tab/browser window
    # <meta charset="UTF-8"> - sets characters encoding (UTF-8 supports most characters)
    # <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> - for mobile responsiveness
    # <link> - connect external css files
    # <style> - for using internal css
    # <script> - internal/external scripts (js)
    # <meta name="description"> - description for the SEO's
5. <body> - everything that the user sees and interacts that goes under the body tag
-->

<!-- 3. Text Formatting Tags -->
<!-- <h1> to <h6> - headings (h1 is largest, h6 is smallest) -->
<!-- <p> - paragraph -->
<!-- <strong> - bold and important -->
<!-- <emp> - italic and emphasized -->
<!-- <br> - line break -->
<!-- <hr> - horizontal rule (divider) -->

<!-- 4. Lists -->

<!-- # <ol> - Ordered Lists - list where sequence matters -->
<!-- i.e 
 <ol>
    <li>One</li>
    <li>Two</li>
    <li>Three</li>
 </ol>
 -> the output will be 1,2,3 (by default it will 1,2,3 and so on)
 -> with the type attribute of a <ol> tag we can customise the numbers with letters i.e <ol type="A"></ol>
     -->

<!-- # <ul> - Unordered Lists - list where the orders doesn't matter -->
<!-- i.e 
 <ul>
    <li>One</li>
    <li>Two</li>
    <li>Three</li>
 </ul>
 -> the output will be bullets
 -> we can customize this with css list-style-type prop with values as square etc...
  -->

<!-- # <dl> - Definition Lists - list with definitions, it doesn't use bullets or numbers -->
<!-- i.e 
 <dl> - definition list (wrapper)
    <dt>HTML<dt> - defintion term
    <dd>Its Hypertext Markup Language</dd> - definition description
 </dl>
-->

<!-- 5. Links and Images -->

<!-- # Links -->
<!-- <a /> - anchor tag - a link from one to another page could be internal, external, a section of a same page, a file or even a email address -->
<!-- i.e <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a> -->
<!-- attributes of anchor tag -->
<!-- href - url or a file path to link -->
<!-- target - where to open the link (_blank - new tab), (_self - current tab) -->
<!-- title - its tooltip text when hovered -->
<!-- download - prompts file download instead of opening a link -->
<!-- Use rel="noopener noreferrer" when using target="_blank" for security reasons. -->

<!-- # Images -->
<!-- <img /> - to embed visual content on a web page (photos, diagrams, icons etc...) -->
<!-- i.e <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image"> -->
<!-- attributes of img tag -->
<!-- src - path to the image -->
<!-- alt - alternative text shown (if image fails to load) -->
<!-- width and height - set image dimensions with px or percentage -->
<!-- title - its tooltip text when hovered -->
<!-- loading="lazy" - defers image loading for performance -->
<!-- Lazy loading is a performance optimization technique where images (or other resources) are not loaded until they are needed â€” usually when they are about to appear in the viewport (visible part of the browser window). -->
<!-- loading attribute has three values
 1. lazy - Defers loading until image is near the viewport
 2. eager - Loads the image as soon as the page loads (default for some cases)
 3. auto - Browser decides whether to lazy load or not
 -->
